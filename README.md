*For the first time, every Bengali Durga Puja association can see exactly where it stands in the world — and precisely what it can do to rise.*

## What Is the GDPDI?

The **Global Durga Puja Digital Index** is the world's first structured ranking of Durga Puja association websites across all nations. Durga Puja is a **UNESCO-inscribed Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity** (December 2021), celebrated by Bengali communities on six continents.

Every website is scored against eleven internationally grounded criteria — from visual design and mobile responsiveness to Bengali language provision and AI adoption. Every score is transparent and independently verifiable by visiting the association's own website.

## Embed Your Association's Rank Badge

Any association in the index can display a live rank badge on its own website — showing global rank, continent rank, national rank, state rank (India), and score, with an animated scrolling ticker.

**How to get your embed code:**

1. Go to **[gdpdi.github.io/gdpdi](https://gdpdi.github.io/gdpdi)**
2. Scroll to **Embed Your Association's Rank Badge** (or tap it in the navigation bar)
3. Type your association's name in the search box and select it from the dropdown
4. Your personalised code appears instantly — choose **iframe**, **Pure HTML**, or **Script tag**
5. Click **Copy Code** and paste it into your website

**Supported platforms:** Wix · Squarespace · WordPress · Raw HTML · GitHub Pages · Webflow

The iframe and script tag versions update automatically with each new GDPDI edition.

---

## New Editions & Re-evaluation

Every association already in the index is **re-evaluated automatically** with each new edition of the GDPDI — no action or request is needed. If your website has improved since the last evaluation, those improvements will be captured in the next edition.

**To have your association considered for inclusion in a future edition**, open an issue on this repository with your association name and website URL:
