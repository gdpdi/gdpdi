## 📖 What Is GDPDI?

The **Global Durga Puja Digital Index** is the world's first structured, standards-based ranking of Durga Puja association websites across all nations.

**Durga Puja is a UNESCO-inscribed Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity** (December 2021). Celebrated across five continents by the global Bengali diaspora, the festival's digital presence had never been systematically evaluated — until now.

Every association website is scored against **11 internationally accepted criteria** using frameworks from W3C, Nielsen Norman Group, Google, and Gartner. Scores are transparent, reproducible, and independently verifiable.

This is an **independent research project by GDPDI Independent Research** — not affiliated with any employer, organisation, or institution.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement

Behind every well-ranked website is a person who builds and maintains their association's digital presence — quietly, without recognition. They debug links at midnight, upload puja schedules, and think about how to serve their community better.

**Your work is what the world sees. This index sees you.**
