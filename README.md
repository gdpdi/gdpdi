*For the first time, every Bengali association can see exactly where it stands in the world &mdash; and precisely what it needs to do to rise.*

## What Is the GDPDI?

The **Global Durga Puja Digital Index** is the world's first structured ranking of Durga Puja association websites across all nations. Durga Puja is a **UNESCO-inscribed Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity** (December 2021), celebrated by Bengali communities on six continents.

Every website in the index is scored against eleven internationally grounded criteria &mdash; from visual design and mobile performance to Bengali language provision and AI adoption. Every score is transparent and independently verifiable by visiting the association's own website.

## Embed Your Association's Rank Badge

Any association listed in the index can display a live rank badge on its own website. The badge shows the global rank, continent rank, national rank, state rank (for India), and score &mdash; with an animated ticker.

**To get your embed code:**
1. Go to [gdpdi.github.io/gdpdi](https://gdpdi.github.io/gdpdi)
2. Scroll to **"Embed Your Association's Rank Badge"** or tap it in the navigation bar
3. Type your association's name in the search box and select it from the dropdown
4. Your personalised embed code appears instantly &mdash; choose iframe, Pure HTML, or Script tag
5. Click **Copy Code** and paste it into your website

Three formats are available:

**iframe** &mdash; works on Wix, Squarespace, raw HTML, GitHub Pages:
```html
<iframe
  src="https://gdpdi.github.io/gdpdi/embed.html?id=YOUR_ASSOCIATION_ID"
  width="360" height="200"
  frameborder="0" scrolling="no"
  style="border-radius:14px;border:none;max-width:100%;"
  title="GDPDI Rank Badge"
></iframe>
```
*(The correct ID for your association is generated automatically when you search on the website &mdash; you do not need to know it in advance.)*

**Pure HTML** &mdash; fully self-contained, no JavaScript. Use this if your platform blocks iframes.

**Script tag** &mdash; dynamically injects the iframe. Best for WordPress and custom-coded sites.
